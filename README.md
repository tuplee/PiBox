# PiBox

You know when you don't want to go to class because it is a 3 hour long session on material you took notes on last week, but you have to go because the teacher assigned a quiz? A quiz that takes you less than 10 minutes to write so you now feel compelled to sneak out when no one is looking so you don't have to spend another 2 hours and 45 minutes sitting in an uncomfortable classroom where you can't get any real work done?

Because I do.

It would be nice if I could just write the quiz from home, but the quiz is locked to a specific network and I live too far away to try some yagi black magic.

In fact, it would be nice in general if I could visit a location with a network I want to use, leave a computer somewhere in the vicinty, and then remote into that computer so that I can explore the networks local to that device. 

Essentially I need a battery-powered router that I can remote into, but I need it to display a GUI so I can use web browsers on that router. That's the idea of PiBox. Yes I know PiBox is already known as a NAS. I can't think of a better name and I don't really care at this point. Let's build it first.

See the reference links file to get acquainted with the the technologies involved. See the connection diagram to get a visual idea of the project - better diagrams are in the works.

There are possibly some kinks to work out still regarding routing behind CG-NAT & power supply management (wake the system at a specific time and start VNC client + interfaces so battery power is prolonged).

Anyways this is a fun but likely expensive project. 500ish seems like the low end, which means prototyping on my end won't be happening for another month. If you have the resources and the want, feel free to contribute!

Aloha
